# Overview

I created a simple Android app the allows an user to take a quiz that has answer A, B, or C. If they select the correct answer, the tile they select will change to say "Correct" if not it will say "Wrong"

I wrote this software because I am unfamiliar with writing apps, and the Kotlin language in general. I think this was a great way to pave a path for my foundation and duture as a computer scientist.

This siftware was developed entirely with the graphic user interface IntelliJ IDEA

Kotlin was the primary programming language used for this application.
